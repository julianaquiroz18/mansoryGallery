## The challenge

This challenge was about build a masonry gallery using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and Vanilla JavaScript. Other frameworks or libraries was not allowed to be used.

Requirements:
- The images need to have a hover animation. Leave that up to you.
- Each image needs to have a link that opens in a new tab and a title that appears 
on hover with an animation.
- The page needs to have a select input with different categories to filter the 
images. The images need to have an animation each time they get readjusted
because of the filter.
- The page needs to have a section where people can add images to the gallery. It
does not need to be saved locally or to a database. It is purely dynamic. It
should have:
    - A field for a link to the image,
    - A field for a link to another page,
    - A select button for the category and also a field the title of the image.
    - This section needs to be hidden by default and open with a button that
    says “add new image”.

- The url needs to be changed as the select filter changes. Also if I go to an url that
select input needs to be set on the corresponding query.
- Finally the images need to have an icon on the corner that appears on hover, if
the user presses the icon the image would be removed from the gallery.
